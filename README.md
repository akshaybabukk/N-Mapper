 Executed various Nmap commands to identify live hosts, open ports, running services, and
 operating systems across network environments.

<h3>System Preparation</h3>
Use two virtual machines (VMware or VirtualBox):
<ul>
   <li>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Server)</li>
<li>Windows 10 (Client)</li>
</ul>

Configure network as Host-Only or Internal Network so both systems communicate.
